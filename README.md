Urbanization has led to the widespread construction of high-rise apartments with thin
partition walls that provide inadequate sound insulation. Current solutions, such as thick
insulation layers and acoustic panels, are costly, bulky, and inefficient against low-frequency
noises. This research proposes an innovative Adaptive Acoustic Metamaterial (AAM) Panel,
an ultra-thin, smart system capable of actively canceling noise. The AAM panel employs
piezoelectric actuators, locally resonant metamaterials (LRMs), and phase-change materials
(PCMs) to provide real-time noise cancellation and adaptive soundproofing. This article
explores the underlying physics, design methodology, and potential applications of AAM
technology.
